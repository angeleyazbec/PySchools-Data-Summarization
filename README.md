# PySchools-Data-Summarization

Analyzed the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance. 

PyCitySchools_Script shows all of the interim steps of the analysis, whereas the PyCitySchools_CleanScript shows only the relevant output summarizing the key metrics.

Final analysis and report includes the following:

### District Summary
* District's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students

  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
