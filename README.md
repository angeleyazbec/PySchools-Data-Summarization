  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### School Summary

  * Overview table summarizing key metrics about each school, including:
    * School Name
    * School Type
    * Total Students
    * Total School Budget

### Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* Table highlighting the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include all of the same metrics as above.

### Math Scores by Grade

* Table listing the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* Table listing the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* Table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Scores by School Size

* Repeated the above breakdown, but this time grouped schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

### Scores by School Type
